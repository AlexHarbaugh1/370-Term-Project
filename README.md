# 370-Term-Project

This is our term project for CS 370. It is a messaging application using the basic socket package inside of Python. The user will run the server, and then run the client file in another dedicated terminal. The client file can be duplicated to add extra users. I would to add some GUI functionality to the program, as of right now it only functions in the command terminal.
