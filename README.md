# 370-Term-Project

This is our term project for CS 370. It is a messaging application using the basic socket package inside of Python. The user will run the server, and then run the client file in another dedicated terminal. The client file can be duplicated to add extra users. I would to add some GUI functionality to the program, as of right now it only functions in the command terminal. 

To run the server, and client follow the following instructions:

Requirements: 
Python 3.x installed
[PyQt5] Library

1. Download the Repository
2. Open terminal and run cd "destination to folder"
3. Establish the server "py server.py"
4. Join as a client (in a new terminal) "py client.py"
5.Chat!!
